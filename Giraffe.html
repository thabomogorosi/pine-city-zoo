                    <h3>Giraffe</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. 
                        It is a species of the genus Giraffa, which is part of the family Giraffidae.</p>
                        <p>Giraffes are known for their long necks, which allow them to reach high branches and foliage.</p>
                        <p>They are herbivorous and primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs.</p>
                        <p>Giraffes are social animals and often form loose herds, which provide protection against predators.</p>
                        <p>They are known for their unique coat patterns, which vary among individuals and subspecies.</p>
                        <p>Giraffes are found in various habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.</p>
                        <p>They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of vegetation and providing food for other animals.</p>
                        <p>Giraffes are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.</p>
