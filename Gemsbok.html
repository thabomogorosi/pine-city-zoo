                    <h3>Gemsbok</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok is a large antelope with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. 
                        It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa and is well adapted to survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
                        <p>Gemsboks are known for their remarkable ability to withstand extreme temperatures and can go for long periods without water.</p>
                        <p>They are social animals and often form herds, which provide protection against predators.</p>
                        <p>Gemsboks are herbivorous and primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and shrubs.</p>
                        <p>They are known for their agility and speed, which help them escape from predators such as lions and hyenas.</p>
