                    <h3>Elephant</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. 
                        They are the largest existing land animals. Two species are traditionally recognized, 
                        the African elephant and the Asian elephant.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and strong family bonds.</p>
                    <p>They are herbivorous and primarily feed on grasses, fruits, and bark.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are also known for their long trunks, which are used for a variety of purposes, 
                        including feeding, drinking, and social interactions.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are found in various habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands.</p>
                    <p>They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of vegetation and creating water holes that benefit other animals.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are threatened by habitat loss, poaching for their ivory tusks, and human-wildlife conflict.</p>
