                    <h3>Insect</h3>
                    <p>Insects are the most diverse group of animals on Earth, with millions of species identified and many more yet to be discovered. 
                        They play crucial roles in ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and as a food source for other animals.</p>
                    <p>Insects have a wide range of adaptations that allow them to thrive in various environments, from deserts to rainforests.</p>
                    <p>They have a segmented body, exoskeleton, and jointed legs, which are characteristic features of arthropods.</p>
