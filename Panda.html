                    <h3>Panda</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear species native to China. 
                        It is characterized by its distinctive black and white fur and is known for its gentle demeanor.</p>
                    <p>Giant pandas primarily feed on bamboo, which makes up about 99% of their diet.
                        They have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from this fibrous plant.</p>  
                    <p>Giant pandas are solitary animals and prefer to live alone, except during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs.</p>
                    <p>They are known for their playful behavior, often climbing trees and rolling around in the grass.</p>
                    <p>Giant pandas are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss and low birth rates in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect their natural habitat and increase their population.</p>
                    <p>Giant pandas are also a symbol of wildlife conservation and are often used as ambassadors for environmental protection.</p>
                    <p>They are known for their unique vocalizations, which include bleats, honks, and growls.</p>
                    <p>Giant pandas have a specialized wrist bone that acts as an opposable thumb, allowing them to grasp bamboo and other objects.</p>
                    <p>They are also known for their strong sense of smell, which helps them locate food and communicate with other pandas.</p>
