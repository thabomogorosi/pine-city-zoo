                    <h3>Koala</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling lifestyle. 
                        They have a stout, tailless body, large round ears, and a flat nose.</p>
                    <p>Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals.
                        They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify the leaves.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are mostly nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in trees, 
                        where they can be safe from predators.</p>
                    <p>They are social animals and often live in loose colonies, communicating through vocalizations and scent markings.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are known for their unique vocalizations, which can be heard over long distances.</p>
                    <p>They are also known for their strong sense of smell, which helps them locate food and communicate with other koalas.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are threatened by habitat loss, bushfires, and disease.</p>
